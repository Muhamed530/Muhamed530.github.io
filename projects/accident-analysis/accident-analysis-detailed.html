      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">🚦 When Are Charlotte's Roads Most Dangerous?</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Every driver has felt it: the frustration of rush-hour traffic, the nervousness of driving on icy mornings, or the late-night silence of near-empty streets. But when do accidents actually happen most often — and what types of accidents are most common?</p>
      
      <p class="mb-4">To answer this, I analyzed traffic accident data from Charlotte, NC (2018–2019), made publicly available on Kaggle. The dataset contains thousands of accident records, each with information about time, date, and event description.</p>
      
      <div class="bg-blue-50 p-4 rounded-lg mb-6">
        <h4 class="font-semibold mb-2">Key Questions Explored:</h4>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1">
          <li>When during the week are accidents most likely?</li>
          <li>How do accidents vary by season and month?</li>
          <li>What kinds of accidents happen most often?</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h4 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-6 mb-4">Accidents by Time and Day of the Week</h4>
      <div class="text-center mb-4">
        <img src="../../images/Accident_heatmap.png" alt="Accident Heatmap: Hour vs Day of Week" class="rounded-lg shadow max-w-full h-auto mx-auto" />
      </div>
      <p class="mb-4">The heatmap makes one thing clear: rush hours are the danger zones.</p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 space-y-1">
        <li>Morning peaks (7–9 AM) and evening peaks (4–6 PM) dominate, especially on weekdays.</li>
        <li>Fridays show an especially heavy evening spike, lining up with weekend travel.</li>
        <li>Late nights (1–5 AM) are quieter, though not accident-free — especially on weekends.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-400 p-4 mb-6">
        <p><strong>💡 Why it matters:</strong> These trends reflect human patterns. Accidents rise when the roads are congested, when commuters are tired, or when weekend nightlife adds risk. For city officials, this highlights where traffic enforcement and safety campaigns can make the biggest impact.</p>
      </div>

      <h4 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-6 mb-4">Accidents by Month and Season</h4>
      <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 mb-4">
        <div class="text-center">
          <img src="../../images/Accidents_by_month.png" alt="Bar Chart: Accidents by Month" class="rounded-lg shadow max-w-full h-auto mx-auto" />
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-2">Monthly accident patterns</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-center">
          <img src="../../images/Accidents_by_season.png" alt="Bar Chart: Accidents by Season" class="rounded-lg shadow max-w-full h-auto mx-auto" />
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-2">Seasonal trends</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="mb-4">The seasonal story is just as striking:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 space-y-1">
        <li>Fall and winter see the highest accident counts. Shorter daylight hours, wet or icy roads, and holiday travel all contribute.</li>
        <li>December stands out with a clear bump — likely a mix of holiday traffic and winter weather hazards.</li>
        <li>Summer is more stable, though higher vacation travel still keeps accident counts steady.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-400 p-4 mb-6">
        <p><strong>💡 Why it matters:</strong> Seasonal awareness isn't just trivia — it guides practical action. From salting roads in icy months to staggering police patrols during holiday weekends, this data helps the city prepare for predictable spikes in risk.</p>
      </div>

      <h4 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-6 mb-4">What Types of Accidents Happen Most?</h4>
      <div class="text-center mb-4">
        <img src="../../images/Top_10_accidents.png" alt="Bar Chart: Top 10 Accident Types" class="rounded-lg shadow max-w-full h-auto mx-auto" />
      </div>
      <p class="mb-4">Not all accidents are alike. The top 10 event descriptions reveal a few usual suspects:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 space-y-1">
        <li>Rear-end collisions dominate, often linked to congestion or distracted driving.</li>
        <li>Sideswipes highlight the dangers of lane changes and crowded roads.</li>
        <li>Fixed-object crashes — hitting poles, barriers, or signs — show how loss of control or poor conditions can lead to severe accidents.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-400 p-4 mb-6">
        <p><strong>💡 Why it matters:</strong> Recognizing the most common types of accidents helps target prevention. Public awareness campaigns could emphasize safe following distances, while road design improvements could minimize opportunities for sideswipes.</p>
      </div>

      <h4 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-6 mb-4">Key Takeaways</h4>
      <div class="bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6">
        <ul class="space-y-2">
          <li><strong>🕐 Timing matters:</strong> Rush hours are the riskiest.</li>
          <li><strong>🍂 Season matters:</strong> Fall and winter accidents climb sharply.</li>
          <li><strong>🚗 Cause matters:</strong> Rear-end collisions dominate the accident landscape.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p class="mb-6">Together, these findings remind us that accidents aren't random. They follow predictable patterns, shaped by human behavior and the environment. By paying attention to these patterns, drivers can make safer choices, and city planners can design smarter, safer streets.</p>

      <h4 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-6 mb-4">Ethical Considerations</h4>
      <div class="bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-400 p-4 mb-6">
        <ul class="space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Fairness in resource allocation:</strong> If certain neighborhoods or communities experience higher accident rates, city officials must ensure resources (like road maintenance, traffic patrols, and safety campaigns) are distributed equitably.</li>
          <li><strong>Avoiding blame:</strong> Data can point to risky times and conditions, but accidents often involve complex human and environmental factors. Overemphasizing one factor (like "bad drivers") risks oversimplifying the issue.</li>
          <li><strong>Privacy and transparency:</strong> Accident data must be anonymized and responsibly shared, so safety insights can be gained without exposing sensitive information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-3"><strong>👉 In short:</strong> the goal isn't just to count accidents, but to use the data to build safer, fairer streets for everyone.</p>

                  <li>Event descriptions were inconsistent (e.g., "rear end," "rear-end collision"), which required cleaning.</li>
                  <li>Accident description bars still became crowded — grouping less frequent accidents into "Other" might improve readability.</li>
